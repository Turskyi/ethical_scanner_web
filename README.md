# Ethical Scanner – web.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## PROJECT SPECIFICATION

• SDK: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org);

• Version control system: [Git](https://git-scm.com);

• Git Hosting Service: [GitHub](https://github.com);

• CI/CD: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/features/previews) is used to
deliver the new releases to the production environment after every push to the **master** branch;

• Api: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference;

• Architectural pattern:

## Getting started

To run this project locally, you should have Node.js on your machine.
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

• **Code Readability:** code is easily readable with no unnecessary blank lines, no unused variables
or methods, and no commented-out code, all variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively
named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.

## Web Version

In addition to the Android and iOS apps, **Ethical Scanner** offers web-based
access through the following platforms:

1. **Official Website (Embedded):**

- **URL:**
  [https://ethical-scanner.com/web-app](https://ethical-scanner.com/web-app)
- **Description:** This is the primary web presence where you can find the
  embedded version of the Ethical Scanner. It provides the same core
  functionality as the mobile apps.
- _Note: The availability of this custom domain depends on continued
  registration._

2. **Firebase Hosting (Direct Access):**

- **URL:** [https://ethical-scanner.web.app](https://ethical-scanner.web.app)
- **Description:** This provides direct access to the web-deployed version of
  the Flutter application, hosted on Firebase. It allows users to experience the
  app's features directly in their browser.

3. **Vercel Hosting (Alternative/Stable Access):**

- **URL:**
  [https://ethical-scanner-web.vercel.app](https://ethical-scanner-web.vercel.app)
- **Description:** This URL also hosts a web version of the Ethical Scanner. It
  serves as a stable, long-term accessible alternative, particularly as it's
  hosted on Vercel's free tier.

All web versions aim to provide the same functionality as the mobile apps,
allowing you to scan barcodes (if your browser and device support camera access
for web pages) and check product information directly from your browser.
